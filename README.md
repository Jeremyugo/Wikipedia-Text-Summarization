# Wikipedia-Text-Summarization

This is a short but fun project i have always wanted to work on (i have a lot of ideas) and finally got the chance to.

I'm looking forward to utilizing NLP to come up with better, full fleshed projects

Anyway, I found some really helpful materials online and learnt a lot while working on this project.

Have a look at it and let me know what you think
